<h2>Junior IT-Consultant</h2>

<p>
<p>Working in emergency medical service has taught me to cope with</p>
<p>under a lot of pressure. I also know how to take responsibility</p> 
<p>even in difficult situations. I am not afraid to go towards new</p> 
<p>challenges and that is why I have been studying physics and</p> 
<p>chemistry on my own free time. I was so excited about those</p> 
<p>studies that I decided to start study the basic study of information</p> 
<p>technology in University of Helsinki where I studied programming and</p> 
<p>statistics. That is how I got interested in analyzing data.</p>
<p>I am more and more interested about data analyzing after I</p> 
<p>have started the intensive training data and analytics in AW Academy.</p>
</p>
<h2>INTENSIVE TRAINING Data and analytics </h2>
<h3>AW Academy, spring 2021</h3>
<p>
<p>I have completed Academy's Accelerated Learning Program in Data</p>
<p>and analytics. Accelerated Learning is a fast way to a new career for</p>
<p>ambitious and driven individuals with the right skills to acquire</p> 
<p>new knowledge. The education method focuses on high-speed practical</p> 
<p>learning, agile teamwork and continuous feedback dialogue. The education</p>
<p>is always based on specific tasks relevant to the professional role.</p>
<p>This makes the learning process extremely efficient and consultants</p>
<p>can contribute as junior IT consultants from the first day after the</p>
<p>training.</p>

<h2>Previous work experience</h2>
<h3>Superior of emergency medical service (EMS)</h3>
<h4>Rescue department of Kanta-Häme - Kanta-Hämeen pelastuslaitos 04/2016–02/2020 </h4>
<p>
<p>I worked as a superior but I also was person in charge of professional</p>
<p>training in emergency care. I planned training for the whole organization.</p>
<p>I also planned and partially did the material for self-study – the</p>
<p>material was produced to Moodle. To manage these tasks I learned</p>
<p>that continuous learning is a crucial part of my job description.</p> 
<p>I have also worked as a chief of human resources for short times.</p>
</p>
<h3>Nurse in emergency medical service (EMS) </h3>
<h4>Rescue department of Kanta-Häme - Kanta-Hämeen pelastuslaitos 04/2011–03/2016</h4>
<p>
<p>Working as a nurse in EMS includes the responsibility for each EMS mission.</p>
<p>During this job I have taken responsible for my decisions in very</p>
<p>demanding situations. I also have learned to work with important details</p>
<p>under a pressure. This job description has also taught me how to tell the</p>
<p>difference between tasks that are essential or at that moment not so</p>
<p>essential.</p>
<h3>Paramedic in emergency medical service</h3>
<h4>Rescue department of Kant-Häme - Kanta-Hämeen pelastuslaitos 03/2010–04/2011 </h4>
<p>A paramedic is a part of the team that provides emergency care for a patient</p>
<p>or several patients. Heta has worked as a part of that team in every step</p>
<p>– as a superior, nurse in EMS and as a paramedic. That way she knows how</p>
<p>crucial it is that a team works the way it is supposed to work.</p>
